<!-- Doing mobile-first design -->

<!-- Reverse engineer? -->

<!-- Try to pick up on my process toward developing your own; ask ?s -->

<!-- So what do we need to do to make it mobile first? Is everything stacked vertically or horizontally? In other words, are there multiple items in rows or just one? -->

<!-- //Copy or print the mockup shown from the readme. I know these are simple but it's a great habit to get into. It helped me and a lot of other students in my bootcamp a lot -->

<!-- Remember semantic HTML? What should we name the parts ... remember the Holy Grail? children divs of the container? -->

<!-- //The divs are already made. Make borders so you can see what's going on at least and it's in our mockup'. what else is in the mockup? letters !

  Where do we need borders? Everywhere, right? What selector lets you choose all of the elements? -->

<!-- How to find border color? Use Color picker tools???? -->

<!-- Go immediately to dev tools after all is defined. Responsiveness toggle (button) ... toggle is good term for it -->

<!-- //How do we want containers to behave when we are using a mobile device as opposed to a desktop? -->

<!-- //What from we went over Friday will help us get us there? -->

<!-- //How can we tell what our container will do? What tools do we use? -->

<!-- // Start with what you know for sure; you can always change it later to do something you know is coming up in a more advanced way it's done -->
